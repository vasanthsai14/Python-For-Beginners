Voyager 1: The Farthest Human-Made Object from Earth
Voyager 1, launched in 1977, is part of NASA's Voyager program, designed for outer space exploration.
Its primary mission was to study Jupiter and Saturn, leading to discoveries about their atmospheres and moons.
It identified active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io.
After Saturn, Voyager 1 continued on a path out of the solar system.
It carries a Golden Record with sounds and music from Earth, a message for extraterrestrials.
Powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), it's now the farthest human-made object.
In 2012, it entered interstellar space, crossing the heliopause.
Voyager 1 communicates with Earth via NASA's Deep Space Network, with a 21-hour signal delay.
Over time, instruments have been turned off to conserve power, but it still sends data.
The "Pale Blue Dot" image shows Earth from a vast distance.
Its mission continues, transmitting data about interstellar space conditions.
It travels at 38,000 mph (61,000 km/h) relative to the Sun.
Voyager 1 carries a plaque as a message to potential extraterrestrial life.
It symbolizes human exploration and curiosity.
Signal travel time to Earth is about 19 hours.
Voyager 1's data has led to numerous scientific discoveries.
It confirmed entering interstellar space by detecting cosmic ray increases.
Despite age, its instruments still function, exceeding mission expectations.
A testament to NASA's spacecraft durability and longevity.
Voyager 1 inspires scientists, engineers, and space enthusiasts worldwide as it continues its incredible journey through the cosmos.
