An existential crisis, by definition, refers to the ensemble of feelings and questions we have to do with the meaning and purpose of our life.
These questions aren't easy to find answers to, and this can leave us feeling stuck. We feel unsure of how to respond or which way to go, and
it can even impact our lives in a negative way if these feelings persist or worsen.

Existential crises are often be associated with a negative impact on oneâ€™s life, but we forget the positive effect it can have. An existential
crisis means we have the opportunity to get back in touch with our values, meaning and purpose, and with what we want to make of our lives.
This can help us evaluate, plan and adapt our actions and direction in order to lead the life we want and will be happy with.
